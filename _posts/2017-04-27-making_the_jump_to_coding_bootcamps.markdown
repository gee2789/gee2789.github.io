In February of 2017, I joined the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) along with 30 others in what would be one of the most life-changing experiences of my life.  Through this journey, I would learn so much more than just coding.

But is a coding bootcamp right for you?  Here's a short list of things I've experienced during my 12 weeks experience.  My hope is that it gives you another data point in deciding whether joining this experience is right for you.

### 1. Learning How to Learn

I'll be the first to admit that I came into this program expecting I would easily learn this "coding" thing.  I already had numerous data points of success in the corporate world and in academia.  Why should I expect any different during this program?

Instead, I have spent the past 12 weeks struggling and running into wall after wall.  Coding was **hard**.  And as soon as I felt just a little bit of mastery, we would move to a completely new language, framework, and topic.

And this is when I realized **I had been engineering my professional life for comfort.**  During the bootcamp I could almost feel myself physically changing as I remembered how it felt to struggle with big complex problems.  The best part of it?  You realize you can do it.  It's just a matter of focused persistance.

> The truth is: Talent is bullshit. Skill is cultivated. Passion is curated.


### 2. Meeting People Different than You

I was bit older (ok, a lot older) than many of my peers when I started this program.  In the beginning, I remember thinking "I'm one of the only person here with a real career".  It was hubris, to be sure.  Remember what I said about engineering my life for comfort?  This meant my social circles as well.

However, I have been incredibly humbled by my classmates.  I realize I was stuck looking at society through a specific lense that valued a person based on their current career and success.  In reality, many of my classmates who I would've previously classified as "less successful" have been coding circles around me.  It made me realize that **everyone can be a programmer**.  We all have that ability.  It's just a matter of focus and persistance.


### 3. It's Dangerous to Go Alone

There's a concept called Pair Programming where you buddy up with another person and you both work through the code base together.  In the beginning I thought this was a great idea.  Then I realized I was one of the weaker coders in my cohort and it didn't seem so great anymore.  My insecurities and pride kept me from asking for help when I needed it.

Luckily, the Flatiron program kept focusing on pair programming and breaking down the mental walls I had about the whole experience.  This is where having great classmates come into play again.  I was not only able to learn more, but also had the opportunity to teach coding concepts to my classmates.  I also learned a lot more about how I work in a group setting with something as technical, and personal, as writing code.

If you do decide to join a coding bootcampe, make sure you force yourself to step outside your comfort zone.  Ask for help or offer help.  It's dangerous to go alone.

### 4. Learn Love Code

I have loved my experience at Flatiron, but, even now, I'm unsure where this new skill will take me in life.  A lot of people fall into the fallacy of thinking:

*If I don't **love** coding, then I guess it's not for me*

But that's such a fallacy.  I thought about the Flatiron motto:  Learn Love Code.  It's a sequential series of steps to me.  

Learn something.  Become competent and proficient at it so you can see more than just the beginning of a problem.  Do i well enough and you may find you will love what you do.

I can't say I *love* coding, but I know what I've learned is just the tip of the iceberg.  There's so much more struggling and learning left to do and **that** is just as exciting to me as knowing I have the abilities to tackle these challenges head on.

>Don't do what you love. Do something well enough to love what you do.
